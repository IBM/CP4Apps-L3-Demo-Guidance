It\u2019s small, lightweight, and designed with modern cloud-native application development in mind. </p> <p>Open Liberty supports the full MicroProfile and Jakarta EE APIs and is composable, meaning that you can use only the features that you need, keeping the server lightweight, which is great for microservices. It also deploys to every major cloud platform, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry.</p> <p>Operational Modernization gives an operations team the opportunity to embrace modern operations best practices without putting change requirements on the development team.</p> <p>The scaling, routing, clustering, high availability, and continuous availability functionality that were previously provided by the application server middleware, can be provided by the container platform.</p> <p>This allows the operations team to run cloud-native and modernized applications in the same environment with the same standardized logging, monitoring, and security frameworks.</p> <p>The operation modernization solution provided by IBM Cloud Pak for Application is to move existing Java applications to Liberty containers.</p> <p>IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor (TA) is an application modernization tool that is entitled through IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. Transformation Advisor helps you quickly evaluate on-premises Java EE applications for deployment to the cloud.</p> <p>The Transformation Advisor tool provides the following value:</p> <ul> <li>Identifies the Java EE programming models in the app</li> <li>Determines the complexity of replatforming these apps by listing a high-level inventory of the content and structure of each app</li> <li>Highlights Java EE programming model and WebSphere API differences between the WebSphere runtime profile types</li> <li>Identifies Java EE specification implementation differences that might affect the app</li> <li>Generates accelerators for deploying the application to Liberty and containers in a target environment</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the tool provides a recommendation for the right-fit IBM WebSphere Application Server edition and offers advice, best practices, and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or newer versions of WebSphere traditional. It automatically generates a migration bundle with the artifacts you will need to containerize your application running on Liberty and deploy it to OpenShift Cloud Platform, accelerating application migrating to cloud process, minimizing errors and risks and reducing time to market.</p> <p>Operator is the Kubernetes operator and specifically the Liberty operator. Liberty operator is used in the demo to deploy the app running on Liberty to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). The value of operators, in general, is that it really simplifies the amount of configuration required to do a deployment via all the YAML files that are typically required in Kubernetes. Additional benefits specifically to the Liberty operator is that it offers the automation of common tasks, like deploying, scaling, getting dumps, including thread dumps, core dumps and heap dumps, and gathering app logs. Another key benefit of the operator is that it provides out-of-the-box security capability, including certificate management integration with OCP and single sign-on delegation.</p> <p>Kubernetes Kustomize is a tool that is native to Kubernetes that is available for customizing Kubernetes configuration. The idea is that the base configuration can be reused for deployments across different environments like development, staging, and production. The changes and modifications for different environments are provided as the adjustment snippets for the base configuration override. In this demo the deployment YAML file created by Transformation Advisor uses the Kustomize tool.</p> <p>Mod Resorts app is a WebSphere application showing the weather in various locations. This app is initially developed for WebSphere traditional.  In the demo it will be moved to Liberty in a container and deployed to OCP.</p> <p></p> <p>Demo Commands File lists all the commands used to setup and run the demo, so you can open it in a text editor and directly copy/paste the commands during the demo without going through the noVNC control pane. This file is provided to simplify the demo process. The file name is demo-setup-plus-commands.txt and it is in the /home/techzone/appmod-pot-labfiles/demo directory. </p> <p></p> <p>The commands used for this demo start from line 71 of the file.</p> <p></p> <p>In this demo, you are going to showcase how to rapidly deploy and configure the Mod Resorts app in Liberty running on an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). you will show how easy it is to use IBM Transformation Advisors migration artifacts to accelerate the steps of the modernization journey, including build, configuration, and deployment. It will demonstrate that how quickly clients can realize the values from WebSphere Liberty and OCP, which provide greater deployment flexibility and operational efficiencies across the enterprise. You are also going to show how to config and use IBM License Service in OCP.</p> <p>The objectives of this demo are to:</p> <ul> <li>Learn how to use the Transformation Advisor migration bundle to build the application into a container image</li> <li>Learn the role of Kustomize when deploying the migration bundle</li> <li>Learn how to deploy the app to OpenShift with a single command</li> <li>Review the deployment configuration and learn how to configure and use the IBM License Service tracking in OCP</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Deploy%20Java%20App%20to%20OCP/02%20Demo%20Guide/#2-access-transformation-advisor","title":"2   Access Transformation Advisor","text":"<p>Talking Points</p> <p>  To get started in the demo, I will go to IBM Transformation Advisor User Interface to look at the WebSphere applications Transformation Advisor analyzed.</p> <p> At the beginning of this demo, I have already gotten the Transformation Advisor Data Collector run on the WebSphere Application Server and gotten the analysis data loaded into the Transformation Advisor User Interface. </p> <p> Now let me go to Transformation Advisor User Interface to take a look at these applications.

I set the entitlement and the Liberty edition as: the Cloud Pak for Applications and Liberty Core. </p> <p> Additionally, I put a resource limit on the amount of CPU each pod can use and specified it as 1 virtual core. In general, the CPU limit should be set to a value for what the app needs, the value impacts not only the licensing but also the app deployment and overall CPU usage. I did this setting to demo the license tracking capability in OCP. Because in Cloud Pak for Applications Standard edition Liberty Core deployment is based on virtual processor cores in 8 to 1 ratio, meaning that based on the deployment configuration I set, even I have 8 Liberty Core pods running in OCP, I only consumed 1 virtual processor core of Cloud Pak for Applications. </p> <p> Finally, I will show how to access the License tracing service report in OCP.</p> <ol> <li> <p>To review the deployment configurations, double-click the File Manager (A) icon on the Desktop.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the /home/techzone/Downloads/modresorts10war.ear_migrationBundle-demo_ready/deploy/kustomize/base directory.</p> <p>The contents in the directory are displayed.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Click the application-cr.yaml (A) file to open it for reviewing.

To do it, go to the web browser and click the IBM License Service Status-with token (A) bookmark.</p> <p> </p> <p>Note: you can also enter the IBM License Service Status-with token URL as:  https://ibm-licensing-service-instance-ibm-common-services.apps.ocp.ibm.edu/status?token=dnwsnLNwvQ9ie4o9U5mpRhoG</p> <p>The License Service Report is displayed.</p> <p> </p> <p>The report shows that Liberty Core is running in 8 pods with one CPU per pod, so in total you consume 8 CPUs and the total Cloud Pak for Application license consumed is 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let\u2019s see that happened to the report if you remove the Mod Resorts app deployment from the OCP.

Transformation Advisor provides insight to assess the efforts for a migration to WebSphere traditional v9 container and provides a similar set of reports as for Liberty. In addition, Transformation Advisor provides assets to deploy the application into WAS traditional v9 container, for example the Python scripts to configure WAS traditional and to deploy the application, a Dockerfile to deploy the application into WAS traditional in a container as well as Pipeline resources.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Go back to the Transformation Advisor Recommendation page, click the All Java applications (A) link.     </p> </li> <li> <p>Click to expand Migration targets dropdown menu (A), add WebSphere traditional as the migration target (B) and close the dropdown menu.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Click the CustomerOrderServicesApp.ear (A) application name on the WebSphere traditional row.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Scroll down (A) to the Complexity Rules section and expand (B) the section to review the contents.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Scroll to the bottom of the analysis page to show that there are reports also for WebSphere traditional.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Scroll up to the top of the page and click the View migration plan (A) button.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Review the migration files generated by Transformation Advisor.</p> <p> </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Transformation%20Advisor/02%20Demo%20Guide/#11-summary","title":"11  Summary","text":"<p>In this demo, I showed how to evaluate the existing Java application using IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor. The intention of our traditional WebSphere V855 to Liberty scenario is to migrate the Customer Order Services application to the cloud-ready new runtime with minimal code changes. IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor was used to analyze the application for compatibility with traditional WebSphere and determined that only small changes to three classes would be required. It provided next to insight into the application and also several deployment assets.</p> <p>As the demo shown, Transformation Advisor can help to accelerate application migrating to cloud processes, minimize errors and risks and reduce time to market.</p>"}]}
